        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The workplace is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a buzzwordâ€”it's becoming an integral part of how we work, collaborate, and achieve our goals.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Key Areas of AI Impact</h2>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Intelligent Automation</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AI is automating routine tasks that previously consumed hours of manual work. From data entry and report generation to email categorization and meeting scheduling, intelligent automation is freeing up valuable time for more strategic activities. Teams can now focus on high-value work while AI handles the repetitive tasks in the background.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Smart Collaboration</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Modern AI tools are enhancing team collaboration by providing intelligent suggestions, automating file organization, and facilitating seamless communication. Whether it's suggesting the right people to include in a project or automatically organizing shared documents, AI is making teamwork more efficient and effective.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Predictive Insights</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AI-powered analytics are providing teams with unprecedented insights into their workflows and productivity patterns. By analyzing data from various sources, AI can identify bottlenecks, suggest optimizations, and predict potential issues before they arise. This proactive approach is transforming how teams plan and execute their work.

      <div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-50 to-purple-50 rounded-2xl p-8 mb-8 border border-indigo-100">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Real-World Applications</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          At Syphon Labs, we've seen firsthand how AI-powered tools can transform workplace productivity. Our intelligent file management system, for example, has helped teams reduce the time spent searching for documents by up to 70%.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          By automatically organizing files based on content and usage patterns, teams can focus on their core work rather than getting bogged down in administrative tasks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Future of Work</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated productivity tools. The future workplace will be characterized by seamless human-AI collaboration, where AI handles routine tasks while humans focus on creativity, strategy, and innovation.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The key to success in this new era will be embracing AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement. Teams that learn to work effectively with AI tools will have a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace.
