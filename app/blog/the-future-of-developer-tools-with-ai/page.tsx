        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Evolution of Developer Tools</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Developer tools have come a long way from simple text editors to sophisticated integrated development environments. Now, artificial intelligence is ushering in a new era of intelligent development tools that understand code, predict developer needs, and automate routine tasks.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          This transformation is not just about making development faster—it's about making it more accessible, more reliable, and more creative.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Key AI-Powered Features</h2>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Intelligent Code Completion</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Modern AI-powered code editors go far beyond simple autocomplete. They understand the context of your codebase, predict what you're trying to build, and suggest entire functions, classes, or even architectural patterns. This isn't just about typing faster—it's about having an AI assistant that understands your coding style and project structure.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Automated Code Review</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AI can now review code as you write it, catching potential bugs, suggesting optimizations, and ensuring best practices. This real-time feedback helps developers write better code from the start, reducing the need for extensive debugging later.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Intelligent Refactoring</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AI-powered tools can analyze your codebase and suggest intelligent refactoring opportunities. They can identify code smells, suggest better patterns, and even automatically implement improvements while maintaining functionality.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-50 to-purple-50 rounded-2xl p-8 mb-8 border border-indigo-100">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Real-World Impact</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          At Syphon Labs, we've seen how AI-powered development tools can dramatically improve productivity. Our internal development team uses AI-assisted coding tools that have reduced debugging time by 60% and improved code quality significantly.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          The key insight is that AI doesn't replace developers—it amplifies their capabilities, allowing them to focus on creative problem-solving rather than routine tasks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Emerging Trends in AI Development Tools</h2>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Natural Language Programming</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The future of development might involve writing code in natural language. AI systems can translate human descriptions into working code, making programming accessible to non-technical users while still providing powerful capabilities for experienced developers.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Automated Testing</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AI can generate comprehensive test suites by analyzing code behavior and understanding the intended functionality. This ensures better test coverage and reduces the manual effort required for testing.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Intelligent Documentation</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AI tools can automatically generate and maintain documentation by understanding code structure and functionality. This ensures that documentation stays current with code changes and provides better insights for team collaboration.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Challenges and Considerations</h2>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Balancing Automation and Control</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        While AI can automate many development tasks, it's crucial to maintain developer control and understanding. The best AI tools enhance developer capabilities without making them dependent on the AI for basic tasks.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Code Quality and Security</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AI-generated code must meet the same quality and security standards as human-written code. This requires careful validation and review processes to ensure AI suggestions are safe and reliable.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Learning and Adaptation</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Developers need to learn how to work effectively with AI tools. This includes understanding when to trust AI suggestions, how to provide effective feedback, and how to maintain coding skills while leveraging AI assistance.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Future of Development</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As AI development tools become more sophisticated, we can expect a fundamental shift in how software is created. The role of developers will evolve from writing every line of code to orchestrating AI systems and focusing on high-level architecture and creative problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This doesn't mean the end of programming—it means the beginning of a new era where developers can build more complex, more reliable, and more innovative software with the help of intelligent AI assistants.
