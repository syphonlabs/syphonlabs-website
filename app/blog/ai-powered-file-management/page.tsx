        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Evolution of File Management</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          For decades, file management has remained largely unchanged. Users create folders, organize files manually, and hope they can find what they need later. This traditional approach, while functional, doesn't scale with the exponential growth of digital content we're experiencing today.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Enter artificial intelligence. AI-powered file management represents a paradigm shift from manual organization to intelligent, adaptive systems that understand context, predict user needs, and automate routine tasks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Key Innovations in AI File Management</h2>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Intelligent Categorization</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Modern AI systems can analyze file content, metadata, and usage patterns to automatically categorize files. Instead of manually creating folders, AI can suggest logical groupings based on file types, content, and user behavior. For example, a document about "Q4 Sales Report" might be automatically tagged as "Business", "Finance", and "Reports" based on its content and context.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Predictive File Organization</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AI doesn't just organize files—it predicts where new files should go. By learning from your past behavior and understanding the relationships between different files, AI can suggest the optimal location for new documents, images, or other content. This reduces the cognitive load of file management and ensures consistency in organization.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Natural Language Search</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Traditional file search relies on exact matches and metadata. AI-powered search understands natural language queries, allowing users to find files using conversational language. "Show me all the photos from my vacation last summer" or "Find the presentation I worked on last week" become possible with intelligent search capabilities.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-50 to-purple-50 rounded-2xl p-8 mb-8 border border-indigo-100">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Syphon Labs Approach</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          At Syphon Labs, we've developed an AI-powered file explorer that goes beyond simple organization. Our system learns from your workflow, understands the context of your files, and adapts to your unique needs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          By combining advanced machine learning algorithms with intuitive user interfaces, we're creating file management tools that feel natural and intelligent, rather than rigid and mechanical.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Future is Adaptive</h2>
      
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The future of file management isn't about creating better folders—it's about creating systems that adapt to individual users and their unique workflows. AI-powered file management represents a shift from static organization to dynamic, intelligent systems that grow and learn alongside their users.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As we continue to develop more sophisticated AI capabilities, we can expect file management to become increasingly personalized, predictive, and seamless. The goal isn't to eliminate the need for organization, but to make it so intuitive that users barely notice it's happening.
